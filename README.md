# ScannerApp
A Scanner App with on the fly image editing and image scanning, pdf generating and sharing features.

>Installation:

Android Studio offers a complete, integrated IDE experience for Flutter.

Android Studio, version 3.0 or later
Alternatively, you can also use IntelliJ:

IntelliJ IDEA Community, version 2017.1 or later
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, version 2017.1 or later
 
I prefer Android Studio, You are free to use any Text Editor of your choice!!

>Configuration :

You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with command-line.
We need to add Flutter Plugins to Android Stdio/ VS Code to build Apps in Flutter.
Editor plugins provide us with code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, run & debug support, and more.
This makes the job of a developer easy while writing code and while debugging.

>What Next?

Click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
Because Dart is the Language which we will use to write the code of the  App.

>Next?

Yipee!! We are done with the installation and Configuration part, Now have fun building your first Flutter App.

Trust Me, You will have real Fun building Flutter Apps.


>Features:

Built with Dart on top of Google's Flutter Framework.

> What makes our App Special?

Till date there has been plenty of camscanner apps replica been made., but none of them are built with Flutter and most of the native Android Apps use the Open Sourced ScanLibrary which has all the functonalities in them. Which makes it super easy to build a camscanner App in Java. But beacuse Flutter, has no such Libraries as it was released 
on May 2017, no such article , posts or video tutorials are there yet!!
